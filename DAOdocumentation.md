## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
ELS (Ethereum Listing Service) is a decentralized on-chain listing service protocol built on Ethereum. 
Its mission is to address current market issues, such as information opacity, low trust, and disorganized classification, 
by creating a more transparent, secure, and efficient information management system. ELS offers a streamlined, permissionless, 
and community-governed platform for organizing and accessing information, tackling information disarray 
and ineffective categorization within the blockchain ecosystem.
  
## ELS Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>
ELS has created ERC-6150, a hierarchical B+ tree-like structure for NFTs, enabling the dynamic representation of multiple information categories directly through smart contracts. This feature allows users to effortlessly locate the information they need, without worrying about navigating complex directories. Moreover, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is in charge of proposing and approving new categories, as well as managing any invalid information to ensure a transparent and equitable ecosystem. This robust framework promotes user participation and enables the community to play a significant role in the platform's operations.

## Governance Process <a name="governance-process"></a>
The ELS DAO governance process is as follows:

**Create Proposal:**   
Community members create governance proposals and submit them to the ELS DAO.  
**Proposal On-Chain:**   
The proposal is recorded on the blockchain to ensure its immutability.  
**Community Voting:**   
ELS DAO members vote on the proposal, expressing their support or opposition.  
**Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation:**   
The voting results are generated through a zk-verifier, ensuring the results' authenticity and verifiability.  
**Verify Voting Results:**   
The zk-verifier validates the zero-knowledge proof on-chain, ensuring the voting results are genuine.  
**Update Governance Status:**   
Based on the validated voting results, the ELS DAO's governance status is updated accordingly.  
**Execute Proposal:**   
If the proposal receives sufficient support, the proposed changes are executed and take effect.
