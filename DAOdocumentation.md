## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
ELS (Ethereum Listing Service) is a decentralized on-chain listing service protocol built on Ethereum. 
Its mission is to address current market issues, such as information opacity, low trust, and disorganized classification, 
by creating a more transparent, secure, and efficient information management system. ELS offers a streamlined, permissionless, 
and community-governed platform for organizing and accessing information, tackling information disarray 
and ineffective categorization within the blockchain ecosystem.
